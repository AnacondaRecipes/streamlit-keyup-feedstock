  summary: Text input that renders on keyup
  description: |
    If you're collecting text input from your users in your streamlit app, st.text_input 
    works well -- as long as you're happy with waiting to get the response when they're finished typing.

    But, what if you want to get the input out, and do something with it every time they type a new key (AKA "on keyup")?
